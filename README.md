# CSCI323 Project: Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes

This project implements a sentiment classifier to categorize tweets as **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** using multiple Naive Bayes algorithms. The work was completed as part of a university group project for the *Modern Artificial Intelligence* module.

## 🧠 Project Overview
- **Goal**: Classify sentiment from tweet data using Naive Bayes classifiers
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
- **Models Used**:
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - Complement Naive Bayes
  - Bernoulli Naive Bayes

## 📁 Files Included
- `sentiment_analysis_naive_bayes.ipynb`: Main notebook with preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

## 🧪 Key Steps
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF)
   - Split into training, validation, and test sets

2. **Model Implementation**
   - Trained and compared three Naive Bayes variants
   - Performed basic hyperparameter tuning
   - Evaluation using confusion matrices and classification reports

3. **Result Analysis**
   - Compared performance across models
   - Observed model behaviors with imbalanced data

## 📌 Notes
- Dataset is assumed to be a cleaned tweet corpus (due to restrictions, raw data is not included)
- This project focuses on **classic NLP** and interpretable algorithms
- Designed for academic exploration and reproducibility
